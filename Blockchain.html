            <p>A distributed database or record that is shared among a PC organisation's hubs is known as a blockchain. A blockchain keeps data electronically in a digital architecture as a data set. Blockchains are most well-known for playing a crucial role in digital currency systems like Bitcoin by maintaining a reliable and decentralised record of transactions. The advancement of a blockchain is that it creates trust without the need for a trusted outsider by guaranteeing the devotion and security of an information record.
        
        </p>
                <p>The way in which the data is arranged is a key distinction between a blockchain and a shared data collection. In a blockchain, data is gathered in groups called blocks that each include sets of data. The blockchain is an informational chain made up of blocks, each of which has a limited amount of space and is connected to the most recently filled block when it is full. Following that newly added block, all new data is organized into a newly formed block that will then be filled and added to the chain.
        
                </p>
                
            <p> Although a blockchain, as its name suggests, structures its information into bits (obstructs) that are hooked together, a data set typically organizes its information into tables. When carried out in a decentralized manner, this information structure inherently creates an irreversible path of events for information. When a block is filled, it becomes a permanent fixture and a part of this sequence of events. When a block is added to the chain, it receives a certain timestamp

                    <li class="text-left">Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
                    </li>
        
                    <li class="text-left">As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.</li>
                    <li class="text-left">Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-left">In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
                    </li>
        
                    <li class="text-left">Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone. </li>
